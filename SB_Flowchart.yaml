      Highlight
    description: >
      Used to get to the point or highlight of a video.
      If multiple highlight segments could exist,
      choose the use case with the lowest priority number.

      Use cases:
        1. Skipping to the point/most important part of the video.
        2. Skipping to the part of the video referred to by the title.
        3. Skipping to the part of the video referred to by the thumbnail.
        4. Skipping to the part of the video referenced by a preview/teaser.

  sponsor:  # 6
    category: sponsor
    title: >-
      Sponsor
    description: >
      Part of a video which is promoting a product or service not related to the Youtube creator.
      The creator will receive payment for a sponsorship in the form of money or free products.

      If the video is entirely about the product or service,
      leave the initial sponsor disclosure alone and consider submitting a full video label.
      This makes the viewer aware of any potential bias.
      Do not submit on-screen only sponsors that play during content.

  music_non_music:  # 10
    category: music_offtopic
    title: >-
      Music: Non-Music section
    description: >
      Only to be used on videos which feature music as the primary content.
      Segments should mark sections of the video that are not present in official music releases (Ex: Spotify).
      Non-Music exists independently of other categories,
      so it is okay to overlap it with them.
      Do not mark sections which have the music playing in the background.
      For segments at the end of the music,
      only start the cut once the music has gone completely silent.
      Boost your audio as much as you can to avoid prematurely clipping the end.

  platform_split_exclusive:  # 11
    title: >-
      Either _self promo_ or _sponsor_
    description: >
      Please submit multiple sections:
      - While promoting their exclusive: _self promo_.
      - While promoting the platform: _sponsor_.

  intermission:  # 14
    category: intro
    title: >-
      Intermission/Intro animation
    description: >
      Typically found at the start of a video. Segments where an animation, still frame or clip which is 
      repeated in other videos by the same creator is used. In live streams, this can be used to skip past 
      technical issues if no content is present. If the segment starts at the very beginning, please make 
      sure the start time is exactly 0 seconds.

      This does not include spoken introductions unless that spoken introduction is identical to ones seen 
      in other videos by the same creator (Ex: Daily Dose of Internet). A greeting containing speech may be 
      marked as intro if and only if it is separated from the rest of the video with a clear visual AND 
      audio cut. Do not submit skits, time-lapses, slomo, disclaimers to protect viewers, preparation, and 
      cleanup clips. Also, do not use this to skip past content to get to the main point of the video, use 
      highlight instead.

  outro:  # 19
    category: outro
    title: >-
      Endcards/Credits
    description: >
      Typically near or at the end of the video when the credits pop up and/or endcards show.
      It is preferred to separate Interaction Reminders and Self promo. If they cannot be separated cleanly, 
      it is acceptable to include them in Endcards.
      If the segment reaches the very end, make sure the end time matches the exact end time of the video 
      (use the 'end' button in the popup).

  not_disclosure_consider_full_video:  # 26
    title: >-
      Do not submit the disclosure, consider submitting a full video label. (See Wiki)

  unpaid:  # 31
    category: selfpromo
    title: >-
      Unpaid/Self Promotion
    description: >
      Unpaid: the creator will not receive any kind of payment in return for this promotion.
      (Charity drive, free shout out, shout out to someone who helped them, creator giveaway)

      Self Promo: promoting a product or service that is directly related to the Youtube creator themselves.
      They can also be promoting things such as
      a discord server, blog, mailing list, social media, television appearance, or fan meet-up.

      If the segment switches between interaction reminder and unpaid/self promo rapidly,
      include them in this segment.

  interaction:  # 35
    category: interaction
    title: >-
      Interaction Reminder
    description: >
      When a creator is asking you to like, subscribe, turn on notifications, comment, or share the video.
      This may also include them telling you to click on another one of their videos.

      This does not include on-screen animations or graphics of like, subscribe, and notification buttons
      which play during content.
      If you can remove one of these without cutting content or making a bad transition, go ahead.
      If bundled together with an outro or self promo and separating them makes a bad cut or is too short,
      submit it along with that segment.
      If potentially valuable information is included in an interaction reminder,
      use self promo.

  preview:  # 39
    category: preview
    title: >-
      Preview/Recap
    description: >
      Typically at the start or end of a video when a creator is showing a clip of what is coming up later in the video 
      or replaying a clip of what has already happened (not instant replays).
      If a spoken explanation is included in a preview or recap that is not present in the other instance, only submit 
      it if the segment does not skip content or context. 

  filler_tangent:  # 40
    category: filler
    title: >-
      Filler Tangent/ Jokes
    description: >
      Tangential, filler or comedic scenes that are not required to understand the main content of the video.
      This includes time-lapses, B-Roll, fake sponsors, and slow motion or replay clips that don't provide any context.

      Example: Content creator getting distracted by something unrelated

      This is not a catch-all category -
      if the segment fits better into another category,
      choose that category instead.
      Filler should not include useful information or context,
      disclaimers that protect the viewer,
      and segments that are referenced later.
